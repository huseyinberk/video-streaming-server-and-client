BBM 342 - Project 2

to compile C files;
-> g++ sserver.cpp -o sserver -pthread -lrt
or,
-> make
to run server;
-> ./sserver -p [port] -s [channel size] -ch1 [channel1 file] -ch2 [channel2 file] -ch3 [channel3 file]

to compile Java Files;
I used the Intelij IDEA to compile and run, there is a form file for GUI. So that,
This project will not compile in console because of X11 not supported from console.
You must ınstall and activate to run project from console.

Intelij IDEA, 
-> File -> Project Structure 
Shoul change sdk with 1.8 version of Java, and should change module with 
"8-Lambdas, type annotations etc."
-> You must add arguments to run configrations as,
-> a 0.0.0.0 -p [port] -ch [channel number]
Note, channel number must 1,2,3.(ch1, ch2, ch3)

Intelij IDEA will compile and run together.
